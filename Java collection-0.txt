# Need of Collection framework:

Arrays Limitations:
1. Fixed in size.
2. Holds only homogeneous data elements.
3. Arrays concept is not implemented based on standard DS. Hence, ready made methods are nto available.

Collections advantages:
1. Growable in nature.
2. Supports both homogeneous and heterogeneous data.
3. Collections concept is based on standard DS.

Difference between Arrays and Collectons:
Arrays | Collections

1. Fixed in size | Growable in nature.
2. Not suitable wrt memory | suitable wrt memory.
3. suitable wrt performance | Not suitable wrt performance.
4. Can hold primitives and objects | Only objects can be hold. Not primitives.

# Collection and Collection Framework:

Collection: A collection is a group of individual objects as a signle entity.
Collection Framework: It defines several classes and interfaces which can be used to represent a group of objects as a single entity.

Java | C++
1. Collection | Container
2. Collection Framework | STL

* A group of individual objects as a single entity is called collection.
* Collection interface defines the most common methods which are applicable for any object.
* In general collectoin interface is represent as root interface of Collection Framework.
 
Note: There is no concrete class which implements collection interface directly.

=================================================================================================================
Difference between Collection and Collections?

* Collection is an interface which can be used to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity.
* Collections is a utility class present in java.util.package to define several utility methods (Like sorting, searching for collection objects).
